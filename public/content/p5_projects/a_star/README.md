# A* Pathfinding Algorithm

This project is powered by [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js) and originates from [this A* Pathfinding tutorial](http://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/51.1-astar.html). This version generates a new map one second after the last map finishes.

## Interactive A* Pathfinding

There is also an example for testing the A* algorithm against a live drawing.
